desert/arid - irrigation is required for any farming to occur
semiarid - sorghum and millet (drought resistant crops), unreliable yields without irrigation
sub-humid - irrigation only required during dry season, may be too rainy for sorghum/millet
humid - irrigation not required unless for rice


LAND TYPES
For medieval England:
    Arable 35%
    Pasture / Meadow 25%
    Woodland    15%
    Other 25%

    Meadow is pasture that is located near rivers
    This will vary based on the local climate, more pasture in steppe regions, more forest in wet regions, etc

CROPS

types of rice
Lowland, rainfed, which is drought prone, favors medium depth; waterlogged, submergence, and flood prone
Lowland, irrigated, grown in both the wet season and the dry season
Deep water or floating rice
Coastal wetland
Upland rice is also known as Ghaiya rice, well known for its drought tolerance[39]

One liter of wheat flour converted to kilogram equals to 0.53 kg

the average yield for the years 1350â€“1399 was 4.34 seeds produced for each seed sown for wheat, 4.01 for barley, and 2.87 for oats

wheat would yield 250 to 300 liters of grain per acre
125 - 150 kg/ac
100 net
3509 kcal
350,000 kcal/acre

Barley would bring 700-720 liters per acre
500 net
250 kg/ac * 3536 kcal/kg
800,000 kcal/ac




Oats yielded 360-400 liters

1.3mil kcal/acre

Peas 300-340 liters per acre
150 - 170 kg/ac
120 kg/ac net
803 kcal/kg
96360


One pound of flax seed will plant about 300-400 square feet

potatoes - plants less than 10 bushels per acre and get more than 200
5443 kg/acre at 763 kcal / kg
= 4 mil kcal/acre

Grain yields of slightly under four times seed grain sown were the norm until the 18th century.(So take your yield and divide by four of under)

the Medieval period was one of poor communications and strong traditions. The new techniques were not broadcast far and wide and, even if they were, most farmers would be reluctant to change their ancient (and reliable) methods


potatoes - ~850 cal / kg


NUTRITION (in million calories per acre per year) (people need 1 million per year)

This is modern numbers and will likely need adjustment
Wheat       6.4 (irrigated)
Corn        12.3 (irrigated)
Potatoes    17.8 (irrigated)
Soybeans    2.1 (irrigated)

6 million kcal/acre/year (feeds 6 people)

20 sqkm = 5000 acres
Thus the maximum yield of a rice-dependent village is 5000 * 6 = 30k miKcal/year
For wheat 5000 * 4
For potatoes 5000 * 5

1 farmer and their family (of about 5) can work up to 16 acres (?)
    or 3-4 acres per person
    1-2 acres feeds a single family

rice
2 t/ha
0.8 t/acre
725 kg/acre = 6 mil kcal/year


6,000 k kcal/acre
0.725 k kcal/acre

8275 kcal/kg

Chickens - everywhere
Buffalo - subhumid, moist subhumid, humid (where there is rice)
cows everywhere with grass
ducks are preferred in coastal regions
horses - steppe regions
